Practice questions

Multithreading – Theory (Short & Simple)

Multithreading is a feature in Java that allows a program to run multiple tasks at the same time.
Each task runs in a separate thread, sharing the same memory.

Why multithreading?

Better performance

Faster execution

Useful in games, servers, downloading, background tasks

Ways to create a thread

Extend Thread class

Implement Runnable interface

Thread lifecycle

New → Runnable → Running → Blocked → Dead

Exception Handling – Theory 

An exception is an error that occurs during program execution and stops the normal flow.

Java provides exception handling to prevent the program from crashing.

Why handle exceptions?

Avoid program crash

Show user-friendly messages

Handle critical errors safely

Keywords used

try → code that may cause error

catch → handles the error

finally → always runs

throw → throw exception manually

throws → declare exception

Types of Exceptions

Checked Exception (compile-time)

Unchecked Exception (runtime)

Errors (system-level issues)
